# Student Result Analyzer

A Python mini project demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, exception handling, and clean code practices through a simple student result analysis system.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Result Analyzer is a console-based Python application that allows users to:
- Add student records with marks
- Validate input data
- Determine pass/fail status
- Calculate average marks of students

This project focuses on writing **clean, modular, and reusable Python code** using OOP principles.

## 🚀 Features

- Add student details with validation
- Pass/Fail evaluation based on marks
- Average marks calculation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Clear and readable output

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (`__init__`)  
- Encapsulation  
- Composition  
- Exception Handling (`try`, `except`, `raise`)  
- Assertions  
- Special methods (`__str__`)
